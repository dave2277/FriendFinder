# FriendFinder

Friend finder is an application designed to demonstrate working knowledge of express.js routing.  
The user must enter a name, URL link to a profile picture, and responses to the survey questions which upon submit will be calculated against the existing set of values within the friends.js object.  The closest match is calcuated based on a comparison between the user's survey responses and the responses of the extant set of friends.

Once the calculation has completed, the name and picture of the matching friend is presented to the user in the form of a modal.

Please feel free to sample the application via Heroku:
